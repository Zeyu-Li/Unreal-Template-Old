# Unreal Engine 4 Tutorial

## Preface

Unreal engine 4 is a powerful tool that has plenty of functionality built in. If you want a powerful 3D engine to build games, demos, or music videos (like the [Crab Rave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE0wfjsybIQ)), you are in the right place. For this tutorial, I will be using version 4.25.0 but following version should be quite similar

## 1. Install

The Unreal engine is a product of Epic Games. Like Unity, it is free to use if your game makes less than $1 000 000 USD in **revenue (not profit)**. After which, 5% goes to Epic. 

1. Sign in/Register to [Epic Games](www.epicgames.com/id/login) (note you can use Google, Facebook, Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, or Nintendo to sign in)

2. Download and install the Epic Game Launcher

3. On the left tab will be a section for Unreal Engine

   ![setup1](images\setup1.jpg)

   Click it

4. As seen above, there are 5 tabs

   1. **Unreal Engine** is where you will see the news about Unreal Engine and some useful links
   2. **Learn** contains links to documentation and other exemplar content
   3. **Marketplace** is a store of assets, plugins and many other things relevant to the Unreal Engine (there are tons of free stuff from Epic and other creators so don't be afraid to import or add from the marketplace)
   4. **Library **is where you will see projects (if you have any) and the version of the Unreal Engine you will be installing. For this tutorial, I will be using 4.25.0. To add an engine, click the plus icon in the **ENGINE VERSIONS** and the newest stable version should be displayed. Next click install and follow the prompts
   5. **Twinmotion** is a CAD plugin that is irrelevant to this tutorial

\* Requirement notes:

Unreal is not a trivial engine and can be quite expensive computationally. Therefore, look at the [requirements](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/GettingStarted/RecommendedSpecifications/index.html) in the Unreal site to  see if your computer is up for the task of running Unreal
